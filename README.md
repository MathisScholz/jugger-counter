# jugger-counter

Just a little Arduino-Code for counting with a sound sensor the regular beats or "stones" in the sport / game called Jugger.
You can find my (german) blog post with arduino wiring here:

I gathered some code snippets at multiple tutorial and learning websites. It is so easy, feel free to use it as you like.

Jugger-counter.ino: Just the noise peak counter.
Jugger-counter_with_LED.ino: The counter and a LED flashing every 1.5 seconds (german style) to help the drummer.
