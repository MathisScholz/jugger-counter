# jugger-counter

Just a little Arduino-Code for counting with a sound sensor the regular beats or "stones" in the sport / game called Jugger.
You can find my (german) blog post with arduino wiring here:

I gathered some code snippets at multiple tutorial and learning websites. It is so easy, feel free to use it as you like.
